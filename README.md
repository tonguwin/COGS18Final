# COGS18Final
For my COGS 18 final project, I created a mystery, RPG styled game. The primary objective of this game is to solve the mystery given to you at the beginning of the game. To do this, the player would follow the game's directions and use strategic thinking to be able to beat the game. The play will die at least once. This is because the game is big on trial and error.
